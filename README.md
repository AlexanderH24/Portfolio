# Alex's Portfolio

This portfolio was made to show my ability to code with HTML and CSS. My first problem was that I started without mobile design in mind. I realized a few days into building my portfolio that I had to try and reformat the entire site to be mobile friendly. I plan on fixing and revamping the entire portfolio.
